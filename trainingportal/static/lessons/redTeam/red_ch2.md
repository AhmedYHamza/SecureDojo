9. Excluded, was part of first challenge - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
10. Excluded, not an attack - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

#### Instructions for Completing the Challenge
- Run a web scanner to identify a vulnerability in the second identified app
- Leverage the vulnerability to find the flag and sign your challenge
