# Solution for Missing Authentication challenge

This challenge showcases a situation where an application fails to verify the user credentials when handling a protected resource.

You will notice in the code sample the `isAuthenticated` function was not called in the servlet `doGet` method.
This means an attacker could **forcefully browse** to the servlet url which is defined with `@WebServlet("/Ch1Loggedin")`

When you navigate to the vulnerable app you will notice that submitting the login page without credentials redirects to `_URL_?redirect=/Ch1Loggedin`

To pass the challenge simply navigate directly to the **redirect** url.
